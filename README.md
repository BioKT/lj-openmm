# LJ OpenMM
A simple program to run simulations of Lennard Jones mixtures in OpenMM.

How to run the code:
You can run the examples for a single component LJ system
or for a mixture.
```
python run_mixture.py/run_single.py
```

For now only single component boxes and two-component mixtures are implemented.
